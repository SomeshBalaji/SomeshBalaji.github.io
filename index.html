    <h1>About us</h1>
    <P class="home">Since our modest beginnings in 2005 with a little space in Toronto’s stylish Yorkville locale, ‘Arabian Hut’s development has been enlivened with the energy to cook and serve solid, Indian-roused takeout food.

        In contrast to other Indian eateries, ‘Arabian Hut’ was made with the explicit expectation to appear as something else.
        
        We realize numerous individuals love Indian sustenance, yet a large number of them loathe or are unconscious of the regularly unfortunate fixings that make run-of-the-mill Indian nourishment taste so great.
        
        Our menu highlights things that utilize the sound and fragrant flavors, however, forget the stuffing ghee, spread, oil, and overwhelming cream.</P>
